All applicaitons environment is set using modules.
From the list of available modules load modules needed by your application.

In general, modules that require other modules load them as a prerequisite
so that no extra loading will be implicitely needed. Applications modules 
loading must be done in SGE submit script or on a command line.

To list available modules :
    module avail

To load needed modules:
    Example 1. load for amber14 compiled with gnu compiler:
        module load amber14/gnu  

    Example 2. load for matlab
        module load matlab

To list loaded modules:
        module list

To unload a module:
        module unload matlab

Unloading is only needed if switching  for differently compiled versions of the same application
or if the previously loaded moduules conflict with a  new needed.

For more info run: 
        man module
